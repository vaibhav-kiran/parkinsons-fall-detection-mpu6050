# Parkinson's Fall Detection Using MPU6050

A machine learning–based fall detection system designed to assist Parkinson’s patients by continuously monitoring body motion using the **MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor**.  
The system detects abnormal motion patterns and predicts whether a **fall has occurred or is likely to occur** using a trained **Random Forest Classifier**.

## Project Overview

This project uses real-time sensor data from an **MPU6050** connected to an **Arduino Uno**, which streams acceleration and gyroscope readings to a **Flask web application**.  
The Flask app hosts a trained ML model that predicts whether the patient is _stable_ or _falling_ and displays live updates on a web dashboard.  
The goal is to create a **low-cost, real-time fall detection system** for Parkinson’s patients that can help trigger early alerts and assist caregivers.

## System Architecture

The system consists of **three main components**:

### 1️ Data Acquisition Layer

- **Hardware:** Arduino Uno + MPU6050 sensor
- **Function:** Continuously measures body motion through 3-axis acceleration and gyroscope data.
- **Communication:** Sends serial data to the connected PC via USB.

### 2️ Data Processing Layer

- **Software:** Python script (`serial_to_flask.py`)
- **Function:**
  - Reads serial data from the Arduino port
  - Formats it into JSON
  - Sends it to the Flask server endpoint (`/predict`) every few seconds

### 3️ Machine Learning & Web Interface Layer

- **Software:** Flask web app (`app.py`)
- **Function:**
  - Receives sensor readings through a POST request
  - Uses a trained **Random Forest model** to classify the motion as “Fall” or “Stable”
  - Displays live prediction results on the dashboard
  - Logs readings for further analysis
